4.8.0 Changes:
	1. Added a new communication system that does not use any 
	   sleeping, polling, or buffering. It uses a centralized 
	   communication server to route communication, allowing for both 
	   IPC and network communication.
	2. Changed proxies and servers to use the new communication 
	   system.
	3. Programs can be run on the client or the server using the new
	   Browser.
	4. Moved all settings to a configuration file.
	5. Added the HACKING and CHANGELOG documents to help contributors
	    get started.
